vimdis.py by m4rkw - edit binary files with vim :P
##################################################

- uses otool to disassemble Mach-O binaries
- edit opcode bytes and save the file to patch
- patched lines will be indicated so you know that the instructions after the opcode are no longer correct
- you can make this "vi" or "vim" in your path and it will still find and execute the real vim correctly.
